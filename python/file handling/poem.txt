          Why?
we work, we try to be better
we work with full zest 
but, why is that we just don't know any letter.

we still give our best.
we have to steal.
but, why is that we still don't get a meal.

we don't get luxury, 
we don't get childhood,
but we still work,
not for us, but for all the others.

why is it that some kids wear shoes,BUT we make them?
